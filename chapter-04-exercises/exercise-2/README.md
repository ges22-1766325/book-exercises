# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

Course Number | Course Title | Instructor Name
------------- | ------------ | ---------------
**PSYCH 448** | *Selected Topics in Psychological Science* | David Gire
**INFO 201** | *Technical Foundations* | Kyle Thayer
**PSYCH 498** | *Directed Reading* | Katherine Foster
